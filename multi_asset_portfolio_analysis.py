#   Q1. Relative Performance of Portfolio - Over the five-year period, the Companies portfolio grew the most, ending at a little over $240,000 from the starting $100,000. The ETFs portfolio came in second, just ahead of the SPY benchmark, which had the lowest final value. This suggests that holding individual stocks gave higher returns, while ETFs and SPY were steadier but not as strong in overall growth.

#   Q2. Trends observed over the 5-year period - All three portfolios generally moved in the same direction, increasing along with the market. The Companies portfolio tended to rise more quickly during good market periods, especially from mid-2023 to 2024, while ETFs and SPY showed more gradual growth. Over time, the gap between the Companies portfolio and the others became clearer, showing higher growth but also more ups and downs.

#   Q3. Any anomalies or significant changes in growth trajectories - There were dips around late 2021 and mid-2022 across all portfolios, but the Companies portfolio dropped more sharply before bouncing back. Starting in early 2023, it recovered faster and moved well ahead of the ETFs and SPY. By 2025, the Companies portfolio had pulled away, while ETFs and SPY stayed on a smoother, more consistent path.

# 4) Beta and Alpha Comparison


import statsmodels.api as sm  


def calculate_beta_alpha(asset_returns, market_returns):
    market_returns.name = 'Market'
    X = sm.add_constant(market_returns)
    model = sm.OLS(asset_returns, X).fit()
    beta = model.params['Market']
    alpha = model.params['const']
    return beta, alpha

# Calculate Beta and Alpha
beta1, alpha1 = calculate_beta_alpha(portfolio1_returns, portfolio3_returns)
beta2, alpha2 = calculate_beta_alpha(portfolio2_returns, portfolio3_returns)
beta3, alpha3 = calculate_beta_alpha(portfolio3_returns, portfolio3_returns)

print("\nBeta and Alpha Comparison:")
print(f"Portfolio 1 (Companies): Beta = {beta1:.4f}, Alpha = {alpha1:.4f}")
print(f"Portfolio 2 (ETFs):      Beta = {beta2:.4f}, Alpha = {alpha2:.4f}")
print(f"Portfolio 3 (SPY):       Beta = {beta3:.4f}, Alpha = {alpha3:.4f}")

    

#   Q1. Which portfolio exhibits the lowest risk (safest portfolio)? - The ETFs portfolio has the lowest Beta (0.9409). That makes it the least risky and safest portfolio compared to Companies (0.9850) and SPY (1.0000).

#   Q2. Which portfolio has the highest excess return? - The Companies portfolio has the highest Alpha (0.0020). That means it delivered the greatest extra return beyond what its market exposure would predict.ETFs also had a small positive Alpha (0.0013), while SPY is ~0 (as expected for the benchmark).

#   2. Select five additional metrics that you are unfamiliar with:
#      2a.  Explain their function , Interpret their values in relation to your portfolio , Determine whether your portfolio performs well or poorly based on these metrics.

#           - Volatility (standard deviation) - A volatility of 0.0491 indicates moderate variability in monthly returns. While some fluctuation exists, itâ€™s not extreme. Acceptable risk level for the observed return, not overly volatile.
#           - Sharpe Ratio - A Sharpe Ratio of 5.1957 is considered excellent, suggesting the portfolio delivers strong returns relative to its risk. The portfolio performs very well on a risk-adjusted basis.
#           - Max Drawdown - A drawdown of -16.74% means the portfolio experienced a significant dip at some point. While the portfolio recovered, this highlights potential vulnerability during market downturns.
#           - Positivie Months - 38 out of 59 months were profitable. Indicates consistent performance  more than 64% of months were positive.
#           - Negative Months - 21 months showed losses.Losses were present but outweighed by gains, supporting overall strong performance.
